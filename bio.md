## About

{:toc}

I am self-taught. I don't say that to brag or boast in fact I feel it is quite the opposite. Had I been wiser in my youth I could have gained this knowledge and sought it out with the copious amount of time that period of my life had provided. However, I did not and as this space has been provided, I will regale any and all who care to read it with my story as to how exactly I came into this space.

It all started way back when, in elementary school. There were computers. More like glorious word processors. My personal first was the Apple IIGS in the 1st grade. I remember it had a word processing program that we could use and even print from as well as the most awesome game [Number Munchers][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_Munchers]

The second major encounter with computers was the Macintosh II and the Macintosh SE. These were the machines that gave me the first inklings of what a computer actually was. Playing games like 'Oregon Trail' and 'Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?'. Shortly after that was the better Macs with programs like 'KidPix' and 'SimCity'. These were mindblowing, and... very expensive, and I only saw them in school. My grandmother had a SmithCorona Word Processor, which she abused at 120 words per minute. 

### The Repression - Why I got grounded...

My next real direct encounter with a computer, was the reason my parents thoughth it best to prohibit me from using a PC for a very long time, and its not what you're probably thinking. My aunt had a machine with Windows NT 4.2. I just clicked things. All of the things. I became fascinated with icons and wanted to change them and customize my (their) desktop experience. I clicked one thing too many in my attempt to make an icon look like the one for Paint. I was told that I broke their machine and caused it to only open Paint no matter what was clicked. I still try to think of what I did. To this day my only hypothesis is that I changed the PATH variables but I may never know.

Oddly enough, my grandparents were the first people I knew to have a computer with the internet(Dial-up mind you). And AOL. Chat Rooms. And all the weird books and manuals that were present in that period of time, and those were MANY. One of them was the Anarchist's Cookbook, which was all my parent's needed to see to feel comfortable in their decision.

Fast forward to the year 1998. We had moved and my neighbor and best friend to this day, had a Mac. With games! [Full Throttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Throttle_(1995_video_game)), and [The Day of the Tentacle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Tentacle) were my absolute favorites. There were many others of course but those held me something fierce.

### The Dawning of the Age of MMO's

So eventually I bought my own PC and began gaming. Warcraft was fresh, and Star Wars Galaxies hadn't imploded yet(right at the Jump To Lightspeed expansion), and all was well. Napster was still a thing and Torrents were better than ever. I played and played never realizing the potential of the machine itself.

I had a grand old time, using the machine for such trivial pursuits. Then I just stopped and pursued art and becoming an artist. Not even realizing what Photoshop and Blender would be. Another thing should have given more thought. I always wanted to make a game. I knew nothing of the difficulties encumbant and at that time I wrote it off as unobtainable. You needed a better PC and all the things encumbant and graphics tablets were expensive and the price of software was just ridiculous. 

### Unreal Engine and Hope restored

When I had found out that the Unreal Engine was free to download and use, I lost my mind. And then Blender?! I couldn't handle it. So amazing all the open source goodies made available by the names I would soon come to recognize and revere.
